AppEtite is an app where you can find restaurants based on you location. You can search for a specific restaurant, save it to your favorites and remove it from your favorites. 

This is a front-end of the app. The back-end is located here: https://github.com/abracadabra89/Final-Project-Backend

To run the app start the backend server(bundle install, rails s) and then start the front-end(npm install, npm start).
